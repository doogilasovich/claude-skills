Help me create an iOS Shortcut called "Log App Idea" for quick voice capture of app ideas.

## What I need:

A shortcut that:
1. Activates dictation so I can speak my idea
2. Saves it to a Reminders list called "App Ideas"
3. Shows a notification confirming it was saved

## Step-by-step guidance needed:

1. First, help me create the "App Ideas" list in Reminders if it doesn't exist
2. Then walk me through creating the shortcut in the Shortcuts app, one action at a time
3. Finally, help me add it to my Lock Screen for quick access

## My setup:
- iPhone with iOS 17+
- I want to trigger it by saying "Hey Siri, log app idea" or tapping from Lock Screen

Please guide me through each step. Wait for me to confirm I've completed each step before moving to the next one.

When I capture ideas, I'll try to say them in this format:
"App idea: [name]. The problem is [problem]. It would be like [inspiration] but for [audience]."

## Alternative: Share this iCloud link

If you prefer, I can create the shortcut on Mac and share it via iCloud link. Just say "create the shortcut link instead" and I'll generate it.
