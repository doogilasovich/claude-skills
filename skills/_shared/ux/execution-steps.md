# UX Audit Execution Steps

Common workflow for UX reviews.

## Pre-Audit

1. Read CLAUDE.md for app context
2. Identify core user flows
3. Note target audience and value prop

## During Audit

4. **Screenshot key screens** - Document current state
5. **Walk happy paths** - Complete core flows
6. **Trigger edge cases** - Empty, error, loading states
7. **Count interactions** - Taps, decisions, inputs
8. **Test assistive tech** - VoiceOver, Dynamic Type
9. **Compare to best-in-class** - Category leaders

## Post-Audit
